# URL Shortener**

URL Shortener is a lightweight front-end application that generates compact, shareable links from long URLs. Designed with modern development tools and a responsive UI, it provides a simple, fast, and accessible way to shorten URLs — ideal for integration into larger content-sharing platforms or solo use.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on delivering a smooth and efficient user experience for URL shortening using a React + TypeScript stack. It demonstrates modular component design, clean layout practices, and an optimized development setup with Vite. While currently a front-end implementation, it is structured for easy expansion into a full-stack solution.

## Features

Input validation for long URLs
Real-time generation of short links (via frontend logic or mock API)
Auto-copy functionality for shortened links
Clean and responsive user interface
Modular and reusable React components
Easily extensible for backend integration
Technologies Used

Category	Tools and Libraries
Framework	React (with TypeScript)
Tooling	Vite, ESLint
Styling	CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS
State Mgmt	React useState, useEffect
Optional	Mock API / LocalStorage (for demo)

## Sample Use Case

A user pastes a long, complex URL — for example, a Google Docs or YouTube link — into the input field. The app validates it, generates a shortened format, and displays it with a copy button. The user clicks "Copy" and shares the short version seamlessly.

## Future Enhancements

Integrate a backend for persistent short links
Add click tracking and analytics
Generate QR codes for shortened URLs
Allow custom aliases (e.g., /my-link)
